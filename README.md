# Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Steering :racing_car:
Do you have a small scale vehichle that you which had a simple obstacle avoidence system? Do you have bunch of sensors lying around and space on your raspberry pi? 

These are exactly the problems this project solves! The goal of this project is to create a data-driven algorithm that will take in data from multiple sources and sensors to output a steering value to avoid obstacles. The project is made to run in a docker which can be used by devices such as a raspberry pi.

## Visuals
The goal looks like the following:

TODO: Add video from OpenDLV with the given recording. 

## Pre-Requirements
To make use of the system following sensors are required on the model vehichle:

*The list is not yet complete. Please check again later!*
- Sensor 1
- Sensor 2
- Sensor 3

TODO: Add information on how sensors can pass data to our application.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
TODO: Add using instructions.
