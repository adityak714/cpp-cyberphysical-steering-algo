#### Team agreement ####
Team members often have different views on how the joint work is to be carried out.  Such differences may be a source of disagreement and of suboptimal project performance, as expectations and personal ambitions may mismatch. It is frequently helpful to start the project by clarifying in an agreement your external conflicts, personal ambitions, etc to the other team members. This document is a template for such an agreement. You may modify it if you wish.	

#### Rules for cooperation ####

__Meetings e.g. Time and place (how often will you meet?)  Procedures (how will you organize the meetings?) Presence at meetings (are all meetings compulsory?) Missing meetings (what’s the procedure if you have to miss a meeting for some reason?) Late arrival (is it ok to be late? If so, how late?)__

Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, starting at 10:00, and ending at 13:00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Fridays will not have specific end time.

We will make use of SCRUM principles and ceremonies.

Tuesdays & Thursdays we will be working sessions and will be doing  stand-ups of around 5-10 mins in order to check on every member’s working progress.

Fridays will be either a checkpoint or end of sprint review, alternating every week. Friday is also used for planning the upcoming week.

By keeping to the schedule. Potential additional/ replacement meetings when they cannot be conducted on-site, can be booked through conversation in Discord. Additional information and discussions can be held there.

Meetings are compulsory to attend, and if for any reason one is not able to attend, he must inform the group the day before unless it is an emergency. One  may submit opinions/ progress to the meeting prior to it occurring if one knows will not attend and have informed the group.

**Division and execution of work e.g. Areas of responsibilities (how will you divide up the work?) Deadlines (how will you ensure that you meet deadlines?)**

We will work to ensure the work is distributed as evenly as possible, with consideration for individual skill levels. The specific tasks should be added to the Kanban Board and assigned to the respective developers.

If one is having trouble with meeting a deadline, they should inform the group in advance and more experienced members can support them.

**Team decisions & Conflicts e.g. How will these be made? Majority? Consensus?**

In order to prevent and solve conflicts from happening it requires the team to follow a **proactive approach** to address the causes of the conflicts. This involves certain activities:

1. Firstly, within the group we will **encourage clear communication between every indidivudal** who is at risk of entering a conflict. By doing this, we can **identify and fix potential conflicts** and therefore avoid them from scaling to bigger ones. This would **encourage collaboration and cooperation between the team members** who have conflicting interests or goals, building understanding as well as trust between them.
2. Secondly, in case of any scaling conflict, as a team we will **establish a procedure of impartial and formal mediation** in order to reach consensus. We will weigh the pros and cons of the specific team decision and try to come to a fair and rational decision. 
If consensus cannot be reached, we will go with a majority vote, and attempt to evaluate further
3. Finally, if the team cannot manage to solve the conflict, then **TAs and the lecturer will be asked to get involved** and offer a potential solution.

By implementing these measures, an environment of understanding and respect can be created, which will help to identify conflicts in their early stages, avoid them or fix them if necessary


**Handling of documents and files e.g. How, who? Versions (how will you keep track of these?) Other tools to use?**

We will use Google Drive for file storage. 


We will have a PMR (Responsible: Askan)
We will use Trello as our project management tool. (Responsible: Oscar) 
Gitlab is a requirement, and will be used for version control, submission and keeping track of issues and milestones. (Responsible: Aditya)
CI/CD handling and workflows (Responsible: Anton)

**Attitudes. Working together (how will we behave towards each other?)Active contribution (how will we ensure this takes place?) Languages (which languages are acceptable? When?)**

We will behave respectfully towards each other. We will strive to help each other, to be open to asking questions, and working collaboratively. We should aim to communicate earnestly so that everyone is well-aware of the situation.

We’ll have a continuous dialogue with our project supervisor about each of our contributions and will also discuss this in our retrospectives.

We will only use English for this project.

**Vacation**

We only expect 50% performance from everyone during easter with only one meeting on friday that week.

**Ambition**

Decide on a couple of sentences about your common goal for this work. Mention something about the project but also about the report.

Our goal is to achieve the highest possible grade while acquiring as much knowledge as possible and improve our collaborative skills. We want to maintain a detailed report to mirror a real-life scenario and aim to create something similar to real-life working situations. 

What is your personal level of **ambition** for this project? Here we recommend that you also discuss the individual course load for each team member and times when a team member may be less available.
